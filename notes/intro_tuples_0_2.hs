{-
  - not a whole lot to say about tuples
  - are nonhomogenious so they can contain different datatypes
  - not dynamically sized like lists
  - use when you know ahead of time how many components a piece of
    data will have
  - the example is storing the first name, last name, age of a person in a tuple
